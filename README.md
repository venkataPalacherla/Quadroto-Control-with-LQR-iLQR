# Multirotor-Drone-Controller
In recent times, drones, especially quadrotors, are being used for important tasks such as surveillance(monitoring), delivery, search and rescue, to name a few. The underlying tasks often pose a complex motion planning and control problem. In this project, a LQR controller is designed for a drone to follow a predefined trajectory and an iLQR controller is designed for the drone to reach a goal position at a fixed time.
